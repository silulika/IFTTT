# IFTTT


IFTTT users have longed for the ability to trigger multiple actions from a single command, making it more like if-this-then-them. So you could for example, press a single button and trigger your lights to go off, your thermostat to turn off, and your security cameras to turn on.

Well, with this app and the IFTTT Maker service you can make that happen!
